# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for creating [AWS SSO Permission Sets][1] and creating AWS SSO Account Assignments, that
  is, assigning IdP (Okta) groups and/or users to AWS SSO permission sets in specific AWS Accounts.

  This component assumes that AWS SSO has already been enabled via the AWS Console (there isn't terraform or AWS CLI
  support for this currently) and that the IdP has been configured to sync users and groups to AWS SSO.
usage: |-
  ### Clickops

  1. Go to root admin account
  1. Select primary region
  1. Go to AWS SSO
  1. Enable AWS SSO

  #### Delegation no longer recommended

  Previously, Cloud Posse recommended delegating SSO to the identity account by following the next 2 steps:

  1. Click Settings > Management
  1. Delegate Identity as an administrator. This can take up to 30 minutes to take effect.

  However, this is no longer recommended. Because the delegated SSO administrator cannot make changes in the `root`
  account and this component needs to be able to make changes in the `root` account, any purported security advantage
  achieved by delegating SSO to the `identity` account is lost.

  Nevertheless, it is also not worth the effort to remove the delegation. If you have already delegated SSO to the
  `identity`, continue on, leaving the stack configuration in the `gbl-identity` stack rather than the currently
  recommended `gbl-root` stack.

  ### Google Workspace

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > > Your identity source is currently configured as 'External identity provider'. To add new groups or edit their
  > > memberships, you must do this using your external identity provider.
  >
  > Groups _cannot_ be created with ClickOps in the AWS console and instead must be created with AWS API.

  Google Workspace is now supported by AWS Identity Center, but Group creation is not automatically handled. After
  [configuring SAML and SCIM with Google Workspace and IAM Identity Center following the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/gs-gwp.html),
  add any Group name to `var.groups` to create the Group with Terraform. Once the setup steps as described in the AWS
  documentation have been completed and the Groups are created with Terraform, Users should automatically populate each
  created Group.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-sso:
        vars:
          groups:
            - "Developers"
            - "Dev Ops"
  ```

  ### Atmos

  **Stack Level**: Global **Deployment**: Must be deployed by root-admin using `atmos` CLI

  Add catalog to `gbl-root` root stack.

  #### `account_assignments`

  The `account_assignments` setting configures access to permission sets for users and groups in accounts, in the
  following structure:

  ```yaml
  <account-name>:
    groups:
      <group-name>:
        permission_sets:
          - <permission-set-name>
    users:
      <user-name>:
        permission_sets:
          - <permission-set-name>
  ```

  - The account names (a.k.a. "stages") must already be configured via the `accounts` component.
  - The user and group names must already exist in AWS SSO. Usually this is accomplished by configuring them in Okta and
    syncing Okta with AWS SSO.
  - The permission sets are defined (by convention) in files names `policy-<permission-set-name>.tf` in the `aws-sso`
    component. The definition includes the name of the permission set. See
    `components/terraform/aws-sso/policy-AdminstratorAccess.tf` for an example.

  #### `identity_roles_accessible`

  The `identity_roles_accessible` element provides a list of role names corresponding to roles created in the
  `iam-primary-roles` component. For each named role, a corresponding permission set will be created which allows the user
  to assume that role. The permission set name is generated in Terraform from the role name using a statement like this one:

  ```
  format("Identity%sTeamAccess", replace(title(replace(team, "_", "-")), "-", ""))
  ```

  ### Defining a new permission set

  1. Give the permission set a name, capitalized, in CamelCase, e.g. `AuditManager`. We will use `NAME` as a placeholder
    for the name in the instructions below. In Terraform, convert the name to lowercase snake case, e.g. `audit_manager`.
  2. Create a file in the `aws-sso` directory with the name `policy-NAME.tf`.
  3. In that file, create a policy as follows:

    ```hcl
    data "aws_iam_policy_document" "TerraformUpdateAccess" {
      # Define the custom policy here
    }

    locals {
      NAME_permission_set = {                         # e.g. audit_manager_permission_set
        name                                = "NAME",  # e.g. AuditManager
        description                         = "<description>",
        relay_state                         = "",
        session_duration                    = "PT1H", # One hour, maximum allowed for chained assumed roles
        tags                                = {},
        inline_policy                       = data.aws_iam_policy_document.NAME.json,
        policy_attachments                  = []  # ARNs of AWS managed IAM policies to attach, e.g. arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
        customer_managed_policy_attachments = []  # ARNs of customer managed IAM policies to attach
      }
    }
    ```

  4. Create a file named `additional-permission-sets-list_override.tf` in the `aws-sso` directory (if it does not already
    exist). This is a [terraform override file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/override),
    meaning its contents will be merged with the main terraform file, and any locals defined in it will override locals
    defined in other files. Having your code in this separate override file makes it possible for the component to
    provide a placeholder local variable so that it works without customization, while allowing you to customize the
    component and still update it without losing your customizations.
  5. In that file, redefine the local variable `overridable_additional_permission_sets` as follows:

    ```hcl
    locals {
      overridable_additional_permission_sets = [
        local.NAME_permission_set,
      ]
    }
    ```

    If you have multiple custom policies, add each one to the list.

  6. With that done, the new permission set will be created when the changes are applied. You can then use it just like
    the others.
  7. If you want the permission set to be able to use Terraform, enable access to the Terraform state read/write (default)
    role in `tfstate-backend`.

  combination of the two):

                Developers:
                  permission_sets:
                    - ReadOnlyAccess
            dev:

                Administrators:
                  permission_sets:

                    - ReadOnlyAccess
                Developers:
                  permission_sets:
                    - AdministratorAccess
                    - ReadOnlyAccess
          aws_teams_accessible:
            - "developers"
            - "devops"
            - "managers"
            - "support"
  ```
